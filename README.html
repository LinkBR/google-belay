  <h1>Installing Belay</h1>

  <ol>
  <li>
  This version of the Belay demo requires <a
  href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>.  If you don't have
  Chrome, download it, install it, and visit this page with it.
  </li>

  <li> <p> After you've done that, <a href="belay.crx">install the extension</a>.
  It will ask for your data on all web sites, and your tabs and browsing
  activity.  If that's OK with you, say yes and the Belay extension will be
  installed.</p></li>

  <li>
  <p>Now Belay will be visible in your extension list, and there should be an
  icon for Belay in the top right, next to the Wrench Menu.  If you have many
  extensions installed, you may have to pull down a drop down list to see it 
  (on a relatively fresh Chrome, it looks like <a href="art/after-install.png">this</a>).
  Clicking on this icon now won't do anything, because we haven't started the
  backend of Belay, where the real work happens.</p></li>

  <li> <p> Next, we're going to start a bunch of Google AppEngine web servers that
  drive Belay Station and the applications in the demo.  If you don't have Google
  AppEngine for Python, get it at the <a
  href="http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html">downloads page</a>.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li> Once you have AppEngine, your startup will vary depending on
your platform.  If you are on a Mac, you can load the applications
into the AppEngine launcher to start them. (Your launcher should
look like <a href="art/appengine-config.png">like this</a>.) There are six
directories you should load: station/, hello/, stickies/,
buzzer/, emote/, and bfriendr/.

If you are on a Linux machine, there is a script, <code>run.sh</code>, in the main
directory of the repository, that takes the path to your AppEngine installation's
<code>dev_appserver.py</code> script and starts each application in its own terminal.
For example, I have AppEngine installed in <code>/home/joe/src/google_appengine</code>,
so I run:

<pre>
./run.sh /home/joe/src/google_appengine/dev_appserver.py
</pre>

<p>
Running this will open seven terminal windows, each running one application.  The
first time you do this, you may get a warning from AppEngine about auto-updating Python versions.
Accepting or rejecting this will have no effect on Belay --- choose whatever you like.
</p>
</li>

<li>

Now we can go back to Chrome and start up Belay Station (which is listening for
requests on port 9001).

</li>

</ol>

<h1>Exploring The Belay Demo</h1>

<p>The Belay extension adds a <img width="16" height="17"
src="chrome-ext/icon.png"/> button to the address bar. Click this
button to enter Belay Station. The primary purpose of Belay Station is
to hold references to the user's items. When you first launch Belay,
this item list is empty. Belay Station also contains links to create
certain well-known items. For example, click on the "Buzzer" and
"Emote" buttons to create instances of each. You can create as many as
you wish; they are all independent.</p>

<p>Emote is an emoticon-posting application that requires a capability
to post to a Buzzer. You can drag the
<img src="art/buzzer-post-chit.png"/> icon from a Buzzer onto an Emote
to give it the capability to post to that Buzzer.  Posting continues
to work even if you pop out Emote and Buzzer instances into their own
windows.</p>

<p>Bfriendr is an instant-messaging application that support sendings
capabilities as messages. Unlike the other applications in the demo,
bfriendr is launched by
visiting <a href="http://localhost:9009/">http://localhost:9009/</a>.
Enter a name, etc. and click "get going"; notice that Belay Station
has a reference to this bfriendr account.  If you
visit <a href="http://localhost:9009/">http://localhost:9009/</a>
again, you can re-launch your account, or create a new, independent
account.</p>

<p>Drag the <img src="art/bfriendr-me.png"/> icon from one bfriendr
onto the invite pane of another bfriendr to introduce them to each
other. These bfriendr's can send messages to each other that include
capabilities.</p>

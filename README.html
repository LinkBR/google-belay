  <h1>Installing Belay</h1>

  <ol>
  <li>
  This version of the Belay demo requires <a
  href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>.  If you don't have
  Chrome, download it, install it, and visit this page with it.
  </li>

  <li> After you've done that, <a href="belay.crx">install the extension</a>.
  It will ask for your data on all web sites, and your tabs and browsing
  activity.  If that's OK with you, say yes and the Belay extension will be
  installed.</li>

  <li>
  <p>Now Belay will be visible in your extension list, and there should be an
  icon for Belay in the top right, next to the Wrench Menu.  If you have many
  extensions installed, you may have to pull down a drop down list to see it.</p>

  <p>
  Clicking on this icon now won't do anything, because we haven't started the
  backend of Belay, where the real work happens.</p></li>

  <li> Next, we're going to start a bunch of Google AppEngine web servers that
  drive Belay Station and the applications in the demo.  If you don't have Google
  AppEngine for Python, get it at the <a
  href="http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html">downloads page</a>.
  </li>

  <li> Once you have AppEngine, your startup will vary depending on your
platform.  If you are on a Mac, you can load the applications into the
AppEngine launcher to start them.  There are seven directories you should load:
belay/, station/, hello/, stickies/, buzzer/, emote/, and bfriendr/.

If you are on a Linux machine, there is a script, <code>run.sh</code>, in the main
directory of the repository, that takes the path to your AppEngine installation's
<code>dev_appserver.py</code> script and starts each application in its own terminal.
For example, I have AppEngine installed in <code>/home/joe/src/google_appengine</code>,
so I run:

<pre>
./run.sh /home/joe/src/google_appengine/dev_appserver.py
</pre>

Running this will open seven terminal windows, each running one application.  The
first time you do this, you may get a warning from AppEngine about auto-updating Python versions.
Accepting or rejecting this will have no effect on Belay --- choose whatever you like.
</li>

<li>

Now we can go back to Chrome and start up Belay Station (which is listening for
requests on port 9001).

</li>

  </ol>

  <h1>Installing Belay</h1>

  <ol>

  <li> <p> The Belay demo has a number of  Google AppEngine web servers that
  drive Belay Station and the applications in the demo.  If you don't have Google
  AppEngine for Python, get it at the <a
  href="http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html">downloads page</a>.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li> Once you have AppEngine, your startup will vary depending on
your platform.  If you are on a Mac, you can load the applications
into the AppEngine launcher to start them. (Your launcher should
look like <a href="art/appengine-config.png">like this</a>.) There are four
directories you should load: station/,
buzzer/, emote/, and bfriendr/.

If you are on a Linux machine, there is a script, <code>run.sh</code>, in the main
directory of the repository, that takes the path to your AppEngine installation's
<code>dev_appserver.py</code> script and starts each application in its own terminal.
For example, I have AppEngine installed in <code>/home/joe/src/google_appengine</code>,
so I run:


<pre>
bob@bob-laptop:~/src/belay$ ./run.sh /home/bob/src/google_appengine/dev_appserver.py
Started belay, pid in /tmp/belay/pids/belay/pid, log in /tmp/belay/logs/belay
Started station, pid in /tmp/belay/pids/station/pid, log in /tmp/belay/logs/station
Started buzzer, pid in /tmp/belay/pids/buzzer/pid, log in /tmp/belay/logs/buzzer
Started emote, pid in /tmp/belay/pids/emote/pid, log in /tmp/belay/logs/emote
Started bfriendr, pid in /tmp/belay/pids/bfriendr/pid, log in /tmp/belay/logs/bfriendr
</pre>

<p>
To get more information on using the startup script and restarting, just run
<code>./run.sh</code> (with no arguments).

</li>
</ol>

<h1>Exploring The Belay Demo</h1>

<p>Visit <a href="https://belay-belay.appspot.com" target="_blank">https://belay-belay.appspot.com</a>
(or <a href="http://localhost:9000" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000</a>
when running a development instance) to enter Belay Station. 
The primary purpose of Belay Station is
to hold references to the user's items. When you first launch Belay,
this item list is empty. Belay Station also contains links to create
certain well-known items. For example, click on the "Buzzer" and
"Emote" buttons to create instances of each. You can create as many as
you wish; they are all independent.</p>

<p>Emote is an emoticon-posting application that requires a capability
to post to a Buzzer. You can drag the
<img src="art/buzzer-post-chit.png"/> icon from a Buzzer onto an Emote
to give it the capability to post to that Buzzer.  Posting continues
to work even if you pop out Emote and Buzzer instances into their own
windows.</p>

<p>Bfriendr is an instant-messaging application that support sendings
capabilities as messages. Unlike the other applications in the demo,
bfriendr is launched by
visiting <a href="http://belay-bfriendr.appspot.com" target="_blank">https://belay-bfriendr.appspot.com</a> 
(or <a href="http://localhost:9009" target="_blank">http://localhost:9009</a> when running
a development instance).
Enter a name, etc. and click "get going"; notice that Belay Station
has a reference to this bfriendr account.  If you
visit <a href="http://belay-bfriendr.appspot.com" target="_blank">bfriendr</a> 
(<a href="http://localhost:9009" target="_blank">local development</a>)
again, you can re-launch your account, or create a new, independent
account.</p>

<p>Drag the <img src="art/bfriendr-me.png"/> icon from one bfriendr
onto the invite pane of another bfriendr to introduce them to each
other. These bfriendr's can send messages to each other that include
capabilities.</p>

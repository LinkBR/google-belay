  <h1>Installing Belay</h1>

  <ol>

  <li>The Belay demo launches a number of Python Google AppEngine web servers that
  drive Belay Station and the applications in the demo.  If you don't have Google
  AppEngine for Python, get it at the <a
  href="http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html">downloads page</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Additionally, Belay can also be used with the Java variant of Google
  AppEngine. If you wish to use this, get it at the <a
  href="http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html">downloads page</a>.
  Once installed, set the environment variable <code>GAE_JAVA_HOME</code> to
  the install directory, e.g. 
  <code>export GAE_JAVA_HOME=~/development/tools/appengine-java-sdk-1.6.1</code>
  </li>

  <li> Once you have AppEngine, your startup will vary depending on
your platform.  If you are on a Mac, you can load the applications
into the AppEngine launcher to start them. (Your launcher should
look like <a href="art/appengine-config.png">like this</a>.) There are five
directories you should load: <code>belay/</code>, <code>station/</code>,
<code>buzzer/</code>, <code>emote/</code>, and <code>bfriendr/</code>.

<p>
If you are on a Linux/Mac machine, the script <code>run.sh</code> in 
the main directory of the repository can be used to start the demos. 
Running this script without any parameters outlines how to use the script. 
If the dev_appserver.py script provided by the Python variant of Google App E
ngine is on your path, then simply executing <code>run.sh restart</code> will 
start all the necessary infrastructure for belay development along with the 
demo applications:
</p>

<pre>
google-belay$ ./run.sh restart
Stopping belay...
Stopping station...
Stopping buzzer...
Stopping emote...
Stopping chat...
Stopping bfriendr...
Started belay, pid in /tmp/belay/pids/belay/pid, log in /tmp/belay/logs/belay, site at http://localhost:9000
Started station, pid in /tmp/belay/pids/station/pid, log in /tmp/belay/logs/station, site at http://localhost:9001
Started buzzer, pid in /tmp/belay/pids/buzzer/pid, log in /tmp/belay/logs/buzzer, site at http://localhost:9004
Started emote, pid in /tmp/belay/pids/emote/pid, log in /tmp/belay/logs/emote, site at http://localhost:9005
Started chat, pid in /tmp/belay/pids/chat/pid, log in /tmp/belay/logs/chat, site at http://localhost:9006
Started bfriendr, pid in /tmp/belay/pids/bfriendr/pid, log in /tmp/belay/logs/bfriendr, site at http://localhost:9009
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, the path to <code>dev_appserver.py</code> can be passed as the
first argument to <code>run.sh</code>. To get more information on using the 
startup script and restarting, just run <code>./run.sh</code> (with no 
arguments).
</p>

<p>On Windows machines, we recommend using <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> to
allow the use of the same script.</p>

<h1>Exploring The Belay Demos</h1>

<p>Visit <a href="https://belay-station.appspot.com" target="_blank">https://belay-station.appspot.com</a>
(or <a href="http://localhost:9001" target="_blank">http://localhost:9001</a>
when running a development instance) to enter Belay Station. 
The primary purpose of Belay Station is
to hold references to the user's application instances. Stations can be created
for a user either by logging in using an OpenID identity from Yahoo or AOL, or
their Google+ identity. When you first launch 
Belay, this item list is empty.</p>
<p>It is currently a requirement that the user's station be open at all times
while they are interacting with other Belay enabled applications. This
constraint will be addressed in future versions of Belay.</p>

<h2>Buzzer</h2>

<p>Buzzer is a simple micro-blog web application, which demonstrates the
ability to grant third parties with the ability to view the blog and to post
to the blog on the user's behalf (but only while the user has their buzzer
instance open). The live version can be found at 
<a href="https://belay-buzzer.appspot.com" target="_blank">https://belay-buzzer.appspot.com</a>
and the development version can be found at <a href="http://localhost:9004">http://localhost:9004</a>.
</p>

<h2>Emote</h2>

<p>Emote is an emoticon-posting application that utilizes a capability
granted from a Buzzer instance. You can drag-and-drop the
<img src="art/buzzer-post-chit.png"/> icon from a Buzzer instance onto an Emote
instance to give it the capability to post to that Buzzer. The live version
can be found at
<a href="//https://belay-emote.appspot.com" target="_blank">https://belay-emote.appspot.com</a>
and the development version can be found at <a href="http://localhost:9005">http://localhost:9005</a>.
</p>

<h2>Bfriendr</h2>

<p>Bfriendr is an instant-messaging application that support sending
capabilities as messages. The live version can be found at
<a href="http://belay-bfriendr.appspot.com" target="_blank">https://belay-bfriendr.appspot.com</a> 
and the development version can be found at <a href="http://localhost:9009" target="_blank">http://localhost:9009</a>.

Enter a name, etc. and click "get going".  If you
visit <a href="http://belay-bfriendr.appspot.com" target="_blank">bfriendr</a> 
(<a href="http://localhost:9009" target="_blank">local development</a>)
again, you can re-launch your account, or create a new, independent
account.</p>

<p>Drag the <img src="art/bfriendr-me.png"/> icon from one bfriendr
onto the invite pane of another bfriendr to introduce them to each
other. These bfriendr's can send messages to each other that include
capabilities.</p>

<h1>Building the Java infrastructure and demos</h1>
<p>In order to build the Java source code and demo applications, in addition
to the Java AppEngine SDK you will require Maven 3.x, which can be downloaded
<a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">here</a>. On a Linux/Mac, one
can then just run <code>make java</code> from the root folder, or run
<code>mvn install</code> from within the Java folder. Additionally, Eclipse
can be used to build the code with the help of the 
<a href="http://eclipse.org/m2e/">m2eclipse plugin</a>.

Description:
Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing your JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.

Local Modifications:
Tweaked to jasmine reporter to show all tests when all pass. See change 36aca5e2cfd6.
